# IMPORTANT NOTES

#
# History
# =======
#
# When we started this database a couple of years ago we were amazed to find that
# almost 2 billion IP addresses in the IPV4 space had been assigned. Today, that
# figure is just over 3 billion. The database has grown from about 2MB unzipped
# to over 5. That's a lot of new assigned IP space for just a few years!
#
# What this database is
# =====================
#
# This Database is operated and maintained by Webnet77 and updated every 24
# hours. It represents over 3 billion IPV4 numbers in use on the internet
# today and includes the IANA reserved IPs.
#
# This Database is automatically reconstituted every 24 hours by special
# software running on our servers. The bottom of the main page shows how long ago
# it was updated as well as giving an the exact time of the next update.
#
# TIP: During updates, the database is unavailable for about 5 minutes. We
#      recommend you **do not** download this database 5 minutes before or after
#      the scheduled update window to avoid the possibility of downloading a
#      blank file.

# IP FROM      IP TO        REGISTRY  ASSIGNED   CTRY CNTRY COUNTRY
# "1346797568","1346801663","ripencc","20010601","IL","ISR","ISRAEL"
#
# IP FROM   : Numerical representation of IP address.
#             Example: (from Right to Left)
#             1.2.3.4 = 4 + (3 * 256) + (2 * 256 * 256) + (1 * 256 * 256 * 256)
#             is 4 + 768 + 13,1072 + 16,777,216 = 16,909,060
#
# REGISTRY  : apcnic, arin, lacnic, ripencc and afrinic
#             Also included as of April 22, 2005 are the IANA IETF Reserved
#             address numbers. These are important since any source claiming
#             to be from one of these IPs must be spoofed.
#
# ASSIGNED  : The date this IP or block was assigned. (In Epoch seconds)
#             NOTE: Where the allocation or assignment has been transferred from
#                   one registry to another, the date represents the date of first
#                   assignment or allocation as received in from the original RIR.
#                   It is noted that where records do not show a date of first
#                   assignment, the date is given as "0".
#
# CTRY      : 2 character international country code
#             NOTE: ISO 3166 2-letter code of the organisation to which the
#             allocation or assignment was made, and the enumerated variances of:
#                  AP - non-specific Asia-Pacific location
#                  CS - Serbia and Montenegro (Formally Czechoslovakia)
#                  YU - Serbia and Montenegro (Formally Yugoslavia) (Being phased out)
#                  EU - non-specific European Union location
#                  FX - France, Metropolitan
#                  PS - Palestinian Territory, Occupied
#                  UK - United Kingdom (standard says GB)
#                * ZZ - IETF RESERVED address space.
#
# NOTE: Although CS is not an ISO-3166 code, it appears to be a colloquial term
# used by registries and appears in the RIR (Regional Internet registry) database.
#
#             These values are not defined in ISO 3166 but are widely used.
#           * IANA Reserved Address space
#
# CNTRY     : Country Abbreviation. Usually 3 Character representation
#
# COUNTRY   : Country Name. Full Country Name.

# UPDATE LOG
# ==========
#
# June 2005    - Countries falling under AFRINIC now show correctly
#
# October 2006 - Many thanks to Lee Cjin Pheow from Singapore for this:
#                As of September 2006, Serbia and Montenegro now have new ISO
#                Country codes. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia and
#                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro.
#
#                We have updated the database to include "RS" and "ME" for these
#                two contries but currently the registries still provide the OLD
#                country code data. Thus you may need to translate the codes
#                "YU" and "CS" -> "ME" and the same for "ME".
#
#                For the most part it appears that translating CS -> RS and
#                YU -> ME works but it is probably not entirely accurate.
#
# Nov 2006     - Added country code for ÅLAND ISLANDS - AX - ALA
# Mar 2007     - Added Country code for JERSEY - JE - JEY
# Mar 2007     - Added ASCENSION ISLAND - AC (Reserved on request of UPU
#                                             Used as a ccTLD)
