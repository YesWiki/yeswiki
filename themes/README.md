# Themes directory

The folder `themes` will be used to install supported themes downloaded from the yeswiki repository.  
This is automatically installed by the action {{update}} in the administration menu.

When doing a fresh install, you will find the default `yeswiki` theme inside.

For your custom themes, please use `custom/themes/` (otherwise there is a risk for loosing custom changes while updating your wiki). You can copy an existing theme there to modify it (priority to `custom/themes/` folder when two identicals names for themes are used).
