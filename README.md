- create, delete, edit or comment on the pages of a site, with any number of editors or pages.
- manage access rights for each page (read, write, or comment) for a user or a group.
- layout a page content in a very intuitive and visual way, using formatting rules which require no technical skills.
- publish immediately any creation or modification of a page.
- analyze and manage the whole site through simple functions : site map, list of users, most recently modified or commented pages, etc.
- a set of templates to suit any site need in term of presentation
- ability for each part of a site to act as Wiki page : title, header, menus, footer etc. can be easily edited from a browser.
- a light but strong anti-spam solution.
- the possibility to embed documents in a page : pictures, mp3, videos, mind maps etc.
- a plugin manager and numerous extensions : user oriented database manager, tags, contact forms, etc.

## Installation

YesWiki can be installed in about ten minutes on a server which supports **PHP >= 5.3** and a MySQL database. Once installed, the YesWiki site is working immediately, and can be managed online from a web browser.

## History

YesWiki grew out of a French language version of [WakkaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WakkaWiki) called [Wikini](http://wikini.net), and hence has strong French language support.
